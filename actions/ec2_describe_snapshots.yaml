  DryRun:
    type: boolean
    description: "Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation."
  SnapshotIds:
    type: array
    description: "One or more snapshot IDs. Default: Describes snapshots for which you have launch permissions."
  OwnerIds:
    type: array
    description: "Returns the snapshots owned by the specified owner. Multiple owners can be specified."
  RestorableByUserIds:
    type: array
    description: "One or more AWS accounts IDs that can create volumes from the snapshot."
  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    description - A description of the snapshot.    owner-alias - Value from an Amazon-maintained list (amazon | aws-marketplace | microsoft) of snapshot owners. Not to be confused with the user-configured AWS account alias, which is set from the IAM consolew.    owner-id - The ID of the AWS account that owns the snapshot.    progress - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80%).    snapshot-id - The snapshot ID.    start-time - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.    status - The status of the snapshot (pending | completed | error).    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    volume-id - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.    volume-size - The size of the volume, in GiB.  "
  NextToken:
    type: string
    description: "The NextToken value returned from a previous paginated DescribeSnapshots request where MaxResults was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the NextToken value. This value is null when there are no more results to return."
  MaxResults:
    type: integer
    description: "The maximum number of snapshot results returned by DescribeSnapshots in paginated output. When this parameter is used, DescribeSnapshots only returns MaxResults results in a single page along with a NextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another DescribeSnapshots request with the returned NextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 1000; if MaxResults is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned. If this parameter is not used, then DescribeSnapshots returns all results. You cannot specify this parameter and the snapshot IDs parameter in the same request."
