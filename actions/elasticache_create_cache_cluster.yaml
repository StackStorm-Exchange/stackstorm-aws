The ID of the replication group to which this cache cluster should belong. If this parameter is specified, the cache cluster is added to the specified replication group as a read replica; otherwise, the cache cluster is a standalone primary that is not part of any replication group. If the specified replication group is Multi-AZ enabled and the Availability Zone is not specified, the cache cluster is created in Availability Zones that provide the best spread of read replicas across Availability Zones.  This parameter is only valid if the Engine parameter is redis. "
