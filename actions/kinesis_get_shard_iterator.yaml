    type: string
    description: "Determines how the shard iterator is used to start reading data records from the shard. The following are the valid Amazon Kinesis shard iterator types:  AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER - Start reading from the position denoted by a specific sequence number, provided in the value StartingSequenceNumber.  AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER - Start reading right after the position denoted by a specific sequence number, provided in the value StartingSequenceNumber.  AT_TIMESTAMP - Start reading from the position denoted by a specific timestamp, provided in the value Timestamp.  TRIM_HORIZON - Start reading at the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system, which is the oldest data record in the shard.  LATEST - Start reading just after the most recent record in the shard, so that you always read the most recent data in the shard.  "

  StartingSequenceNumber:
    type: string
    description: "The sequence number of the data record in the shard from which to start reading. Used with shard iterator type AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER and AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER."
  Timestamp:
    type: string
    description: "The timestamp of the data record from which to start reading. Used with shard iterator type AT_TIMESTAMP. A timestamp is the Unix epoch date with precision in milliseconds. For example, 2016-04-04T19:58:46.480-00:00 or 1459799926.480. If a record with this exact timestamp does not exist, the iterator returned is for the next (later) record. If the timestamp is older than the current trim horizon, the iterator returned is for the oldest untrimmed data record (TRIM_HORIZON)."
