  FunctionName:
    type: string
    description: "The name you want to assign to the function you are uploading. The function names appear in the console and are returned in the ListFunctions API. Function names are used to specify functions to other AWS Lambda API operations, such as Invoke. "
    required: true
  Runtime:
    type: string
    description: "The runtime environment for the Lambda function you are uploading. To use the Node.js runtime v4.3, set the value to 'nodejs4.3'. To use earlier runtime (v0.10.42), set the value to 'nodejs'.  You can no longer create functions using the v0.10.42 runtime version as of November, 2016. Existing functions will be supported until early 2017, but we recommend you migrate them to nodejs4.3 runtime version as soon as possible. "
    required: true
  Role:
    type: string
    description: "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Lambda assumes when it executes your function to access any other Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. For more information, see AWS Lambda: How it Works. "
    required: true
  Handler:
    type: string
    description: "The function within your code that Lambda calls to begin execution. For Node.js, it is the module-name.export value in your function. For Java, it can be package.class-name::handler or package.class-name. For more information, see Lambda Function Handler (Java). "

  Description:
    type: string
    description: "A short, user-defined function description. Lambda does not use this value. Assign a meaningful description as you see fit."
  Timeout:
    type: integer
    description: "The function execution time at which Lambda should terminate the function. Because the execution time has cost implications, we recommend you set this value based on your expected execution time. The default is 3 seconds."
  MemorySize:
    type: integer
    description: "The amount of memory, in MB, your Lambda function is given. Lambda uses this memory size to infer the amount of CPU and memory allocated to your function. Your function use-case determines your CPU and memory requirements. For example, a database operation might need less memory compared to an image processing function. The default value is 128 MB. The value must be a multiple of 64 MB."
  Publish:
    type: boolean
    description: "This boolean parameter can be used to request AWS Lambda to create the Lambda function and publish a version as an atomic operation."
  VpcConfig:
    type: object
    description: "If your Lambda function accesses resources in a VPC, you provide this parameter identifying the list of security group IDs and subnet IDs. These must belong to the same VPC. You must provide at least one security group and one subnet ID."
