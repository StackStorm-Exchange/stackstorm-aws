  BlockDeviceMappings:
    type: array
    description: "The block device mapping.  Supplying both a snapshot ID and an encryption value as arguments for block-device mapping results in an error. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on start, and these are not created from a snapshot. If a snapshot is the basis for the volume, it contains data by definition and its encryption status cannot be changed using this action. "

  DisableApiTermination:
    type: boolean
    description: "If you set this parameter to true, you can't terminate the instance using the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API; otherwise, you can. To change this attribute to false after launch, use ModifyInstanceAttribute. Alternatively, if you set InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior to terminate, you can terminate the instance by running the shutdown command from the instance. Default: false "
  DryRun:
    type: boolean
    description: "Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation."
