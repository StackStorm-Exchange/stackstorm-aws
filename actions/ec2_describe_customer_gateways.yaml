  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    bgp-asn - The customer gateway's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN).    customer-gateway-id - The ID of the customer gateway.    ip-address - The IP address of the customer gateway's Internet-routable external interface.    state - The state of the customer gateway (pending | available | deleting | deleted).    type - The type of customer gateway. Currently, the only supported type is ipsec.1.    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.  "
