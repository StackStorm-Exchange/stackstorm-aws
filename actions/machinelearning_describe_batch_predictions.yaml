    description: "Use one of the following variables to filter a list of BatchPrediction:   CreatedAt - Sets the search criteria to the BatchPrediction creation date.  Status - Sets the search criteria to the BatchPrediction status.  Name - Sets the search criteria to the contents of the BatchPrediction  Name.  IAMUser - Sets the search criteria to the user account that invoked the BatchPrediction creation.  MLModelId - Sets the search criteria to the MLModel used in the BatchPrediction.  DataSourceId - Sets the search criteria to the DataSource used in the BatchPrediction.  DataURI - Sets the search criteria to the data file(s) used in the BatchPrediction.
