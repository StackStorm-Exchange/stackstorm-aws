  Message:
    type: string
    description: "The message you want to send to the topic. If you want to send the same message to all transport protocols, include the text of the message as a String value. If you want to send different messages for each transport protocol, set the value of the MessageStructure parameter to json and use a JSON object for the Message parameter.  Constraints: Messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings at most 256 KB in size (262144 bytes, not 262144 characters). JSON-specific constraints:   Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport protocols must have simple JSON string values.   The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in outgoing messages.   Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters will be reescaped for sending).   Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, '', is allowed).   Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes).   Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.   Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are ignored.   Duplicate keys are not allowed.   Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will cause the Publish call to return an error (no partial delivery).  "

  TopicArn:
    type: string
    description: "The topic you want to publish to. If you don't specify a value for the TopicArn parameter, you must specify a value for the PhoneNumber or TargetArn parameters."
  TargetArn:
    type: string
    description: "Either TopicArn or EndpointArn, but not both. If you don't specify a value for the TargetArn parameter, you must specify a value for the PhoneNumber or TopicArn parameters."
  PhoneNumber:
    type: string
    description: "The phone number to which you want to deliver an SMS message. Use E.164 format. If you don't specify a value for the PhoneNumber parameter, you must specify a value for the TargetArn or TopicArn parameters."
  Subject:
    type: string
    description: "Optional parameter to be used as the 'Subject' line when the message is delivered to email endpoints. This field will also be included, if present, in the standard JSON messages delivered to other endpoints. Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that begins with a letter, number, or punctuation mark; must not include line breaks or control characters; and must be less than 100 characters long."
  MessageStructure:
    type: string
    description: "Set MessageStructure to json if you want to send a different message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message to your email subscribers. If you set MessageStructure to json, the value of the Message parameter must:    be a syntactically valid JSON object; and   contain at least a top-level JSON key of 'default' with a value that is a string.   You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., 'http'). For information about sending different messages for each protocol using the AWS Management Console, go to Create Different Messages for Each Protocol in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Getting Started Guide.
