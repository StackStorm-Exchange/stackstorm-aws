  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    attachment.state - The current state of the attachment between the gateway and the VPC (attaching | attached | detaching | detached).    attachment.vpc-id - The ID of an attached VPC.    availability-zone - The Availability Zone for the virtual private gateway (if applicable).    state - The state of the virtual private gateway (pending | available | deleting | deleted).    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    type - The type of virtual private gateway. Currently the only supported type is ipsec.1.    vpn-gateway-id - The ID of the virtual private gateway.  "
