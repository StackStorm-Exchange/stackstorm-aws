    type: string
    description: "You can filter the results of a ListContainerInstances operation with cluster query language statements. For more information, see Cluster Query Language in the Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide."
  nextToken:
    type: string
    description: "The nextToken value returned from a previous paginated ListContainerInstances request where maxResults was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.  This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes. "
  maxResults:
    type: integer
    description: "The maximum number of container instance results returned by ListContainerInstances in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ListContainerInstances only returns maxResults results in a single page along with a nextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ListContainerInstances request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then ListContainerInstances returns up to 100 results and a nextToken value if applicable."
