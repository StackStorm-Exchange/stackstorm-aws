  Name:
    type: string
    description: "A friendly name for identifying the grant. Use this value to prevent unintended creation of duplicate grants when retrying this request. When this value is absent, all CreateGrant requests result in a new grant with a unique GrantId even if all the supplied parameters are identical. This can result in unintended duplicates when you retry the CreateGrant request. When this value is present, you can retry a CreateGrant request with identical parameters; if the grant already exists, the original GrantId is returned without creating a new grant. Note that the returned grant token is unique with every CreateGrant request, even when a duplicate GrantId is returned. All grant tokens obtained in this way can be used interchangeably."
