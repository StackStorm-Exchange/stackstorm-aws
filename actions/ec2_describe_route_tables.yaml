  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    association.route-table-association-id - The ID of an association ID for the route table.    association.route-table-id - The ID of the route table involved in the association.    association.subnet-id - The ID of the subnet involved in the association.    association.main - Indicates whether the route table is the main route table for the VPC (true | false).    route-table-id - The ID of the route table.    route.destination-cidr-block - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in a route in the table.    route.destination-ipv6-cidr-block - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in a route in the route table.    route.destination-prefix-list-id - The ID (prefix) of the AWS service specified in a route in the table.    route.egress-only-internet-gateway-id - The ID of an egress-only Internet gateway specified in a route in the route table.    route.gateway-id - The ID of a gateway specified in a route in the table.    route.instance-id - The ID of an instance specified in a route in the table.    route.nat-gateway-id - The ID of a NAT gateway.    route.origin - Describes how the route was created. CreateRouteTable indicates that the route was automatically created when the route table was created; CreateRoute indicates that the route was manually added to the route table; EnableVgwRoutePropagation indicates that the route was propagated by route propagation.    route.state - The state of a route in the route table (active | blackhole). The blackhole state indicates that the route's target isn't available (for example, the specified gateway isn't attached to the VPC, the specified NAT instance has been terminated, and so on).    route.vpc-peering-connection-id - The ID of a VPC peering connection specified in a route in the table.    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    vpc-id - The ID of the VPC for the route table.  "
