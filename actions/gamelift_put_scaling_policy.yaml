    description: "Type of adjustment to make to a fleet's instance count (see FleetCapacity):    ChangeInCapacity – add (or subtract) the scaling adjustment value from the current instance count. Positive values scale up while negative values scale down.    ExactCapacity – set the instance count to the scaling adjustment value.    PercentChangeInCapacity – increase or reduce the current instance count by the scaling adjustment, read as a percentage. Positive values scale up while negative values scale down; for example, a value of '-10' scales the fleet down by 10%.  "

CurrentPlayerSessions – number of active or reserved player sessions (player session status = ACTIVE or RESERVED).

This number includes game sessions that are not currently accepting players (game session PlayerSessionCreationPolicy = DENY_ALL).    ActiveInstances – number of instances currently running a game session.    IdleInstances – number of instances not currently running a game session.  "
