    description: "Determines how the shard iterator is used to start reading stream records from the shard:    AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER - Start reading exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number.    AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER - Start reading right after the position denoted by a specific sequence number.    TRIM_HORIZON - Start reading at the last (untrimmed) stream record, which is the oldest record in the shard. In DynamoDB Streams, there is a 24 hour limit on data retention. Stream records whose age exceeds this limit are subject to removal (trimming) from the stream.    LATEST - Start reading just after the most recent stream record in the shard, so that you always read the most recent data in the shard.  "
