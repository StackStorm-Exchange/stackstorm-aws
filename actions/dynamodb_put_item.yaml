    description: "A map of attribute name/value pairs, one for each attribute. Only the primary key attributes are required; you can optionally provide other attribute name-value pairs for the item. You must provide all of the attributes for the primary key. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide both values for both the partition key and the sort key. If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in the table's attribute definition. For more information about primary keys, see Primary Key in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. Each element in the Item map is an AttributeValue object."

  Expected:
    type: object
    description: " This is a legacy parameter, for backward compatibility. New applications should use ConditionExpression instead. Do not combine legacy parameters and expression parameters in a single API call; otherwise, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception.  A map of attribute/condition pairs. Expected provides a conditional block for the PutItem operation.  This parameter does not support attributes of type List or Map.  Each element of Expected consists of an attribute name, a comparison operator, and one or more values. DynamoDB compares the attribute with the value(s) you supplied, using the comparison operator. For each Expected element, the result of the evaluation is either true or false. If you specify more than one element in the Expected map, then by default all of the conditions must evaluate to true. In other words, the conditions are ANDed together. (You can use the ConditionalOperator parameter to OR the conditions instead. If you do this, then at least one of the conditions must evaluate to true, rather than all of them.) If the Expected map evaluates to true, then the conditional operation succeeds; otherwise, it fails.  Expected contains the following:    AttributeValueList - One or more values to evaluate against the supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the ComparisonOperator being used. For type Number, value comparisons are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a is greater than A, and a is greater than B. For a list of code values, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters. For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned when it compares binary values.    ComparisonOperator - A comparator for evaluating attributes in the AttributeValueList. When performing the comparison, DynamoDB uses strongly consistent reads. The following comparison operators are available:  EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN  The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.    EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.  AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {'S':'6'} does not equal {'N':'6'}. Also, {'N':'6'} does not equal {'NS':['6', '2', '1']}.     NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.  AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {'S':'6'} does not equal {'N':'6'}. Also, {'N':'6'} does not equal {'NS':['6', '2', '1']}.     LE : Less than or equal.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {'S':'6'} does not equal {'N':'6'}. Also, {'N':'6'} does not compare to {'NS':['6', '2', '1']}.     LT : Less than.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {'S':'6'} does not equal {'N':'6'}. Also, {'N':'6'} does not compare to {'NS':['6', '2', '1']}.     GE : Greater than or equal.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {'S':'6'} does not equal {'N':'6'}. Also, {'N':'6'} does not compare to {'NS':['6', '2', '1']}.     GT : Greater than.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {'S':'6'} does not equal {'N':'6'}. Also, {'N':'6'} does not compare to {'NS':['6', '2', '1']}.     NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.  This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of attribute 'a' is null, and you evaluate it using NOT_NULL, the result is a Boolean true. This result is because the attribute 'a' exists; its data type is not relevant to the NOT_NULL comparison operator.     NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for all datatypes, including lists and maps.  This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of attribute 'a' is null, and you evaluate it using NULL, the result is a Boolean false. This is because the attribute 'a' exists; its data type is not relevant to the NULL comparison operator.     CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.  AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ('SS', 'NS', or 'BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating 'a CONTAINS b', 'a' can be a list; however, 'b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list.    NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.  AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ('SS', 'NS', or 'BS'), then the operator evaluates to true if it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating 'a NOT CONTAINS b', 'a' can be a list; however, 'b' cannot be a set, a map, or a list.    BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).     IN : Checks for matching elements within two sets.  AttributeValueList can contain one or more AttributeValue elements of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These attributes are compared against an existing set type attribute of an item. If any elements of the input set are present in the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.    BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value.   AttributeValueList must contain two AttributeValue elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {'S':'6'} does not compare to {'N':'6'}. Also, {'N':'6'} does not compare to {'NS':['6', '2', '1']}      For usage examples of AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator, see Legacy Conditional Parameters in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. For backward compatibility with previous DynamoDB releases, the following parameters can be used instead of AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator:    Value - A value for DynamoDB to compare with an attribute.    Exists - A Boolean value that causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value before attempting the conditional operation:   If Exists is true, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the condition evaluates to true; otherwise the condition evaluate to false.   If Exists is false, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the condition evaluates to true. If the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the condition evaluates to false.   Note that the default value for Exists is true.   The Value and Exists parameters are incompatible with AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator. Note that if you use both sets of parameters at once, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception."
  ReturnValues:
    type: string
    description: "Use ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they appeared before they were updated with the PutItem request. For PutItem, the valid values are:    NONE - If ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is NONE, then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for ReturnValues.)    ALL_OLD - If PutItem overwrote an attribute name-value pair, then the content of the old item is returned.    The ReturnValues parameter is used by several DynamoDB operations; however, PutItem does not recognize any values other than NONE or ALL_OLD. "
  ReturnConsumedCapacity:
    type: string
    description: ""
  ReturnItemCollectionMetrics:
    type: string
    description: "Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to SIZE, the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, that were modified during the operation are returned in the response. If set to NONE (the default), no statistics are returned."
  ConditionalOperator:
    type: string
    description: " This is a legacy parameter, for backward compatibility. New applications should use ConditionExpression instead. Do not combine legacy parameters and expression parameters in a single API call; otherwise, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception.  A logical operator to apply to the conditions in the Expected map:    AND - If all of the conditions evaluate to true, then the entire map evaluates to true.    OR - If at least one of the conditions evaluate to true, then the entire map evaluates to true.   If you omit ConditionalOperator, then AND is the default. The operation will succeed only if the entire map evaluates to true.  This parameter does not support attributes of type List or Map. "
  ConditionExpression:
    type: string
    description: "A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional PutItem operation to succeed. An expression can contain any of the following:   Functions: attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size  These function names are case-sensitive.   Comparison operators:  = | &amp;#x3C;&amp;#x3E; | &amp;#x3C; | &amp;#x3E; | &amp;#x3C;= | &amp;#x3E;= | BETWEEN | IN     Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT    For more information on condition expressions, see Specifying Conditions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.   ConditionExpression replaces the legacy ConditionalOperator and Expected parameters. "
  ExpressionAttributeNames:
    type: object
    description: "One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {'#P':'Percentile'}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more information on expression attribute names, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide."
  ExpressionAttributeValues:
    type: object
    description: "One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  { ':avail':{'S':'Available'}, ':back':{'S':'Backordered'}, ':disc':{'S':'Discontinued'} }  You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:  ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)  For more information on expression attribute values, see Specifying Conditions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide."
