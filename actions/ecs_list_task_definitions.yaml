  familyPrefix:
    type: string
    description: "The full family name with which to filter the ListTaskDefinitions results. Specifying a familyPrefix limits the listed task definitions to task definition revisions that belong to that family."
  status:
    type: string
    description: "The task definition status with which to filter the ListTaskDefinitions results. By default, only ACTIVE task definitions are listed. By setting this parameter to INACTIVE, you can view task definitions that are INACTIVE as long as an active task or service still references them. If you paginate the resulting output, be sure to keep the status value constant in each subsequent request."
  sort:
    type: string
    description: "The order in which to sort the results. Valid values are ASC and DESC. By default (ASC), task definitions are listed lexicographically by family name and in ascending numerical order by revision so that the newest task definitions in a family are listed last. Setting this parameter to DESC reverses the sort order on family name and revision so that the newest task definitions in a family are listed first."
  nextToken:
    type: string
    description: "The nextToken value returned from a previous paginated ListTaskDefinitions request where maxResults was used and the results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value. This value is null when there are no more results to return.  This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic purposes. "
  maxResults:
    type: integer
    description: "The maximum number of task definition results returned by ListTaskDefinitions in paginated output. When this parameter is used, ListTaskDefinitions only returns maxResults results in a single page along with a nextToken response element. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ListTaskDefinitions request with the returned nextToken value. This value can be between 1 and 100. If this parameter is not used, then ListTaskDefinitions returns up to 100 results and a nextToken value if applicable."
