  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    customer-gateway-configuration - The configuration information for the customer gateway.    customer-gateway-id - The ID of a customer gateway associated with the VPN connection.    state - The state of the VPN connection (pending | available | deleting | deleted).    option.static-routes-only - Indicates whether the connection has static routes only. Used for devices that do not support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).    route.destination-cidr-block - The destination CIDR block. This corresponds to the subnet used in a customer data center.    bgp-asn - The BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) associated with a BGP device.    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    type - The type of VPN connection. Currently the only supported type is ipsec.1.    vpn-connection-id - The ID of the VPN connection.    vpn-gateway-id - The ID of a virtual private gateway associated with the VPN connection.  "
