    description: "The PerformanceMode of the file system. We recommend generalPurpose performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most file operations. This can't be changed after the file system has been created."
