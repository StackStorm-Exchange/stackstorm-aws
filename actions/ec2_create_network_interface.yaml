  PrivateIpAddress:
    type: string
    description: "The primary private IPv4 address of the network interface. If you don't specify an IPv4 address, Amazon EC2 selects one for you from the subnet's IPv4 CIDR range.

  SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount:
    type: integer
    description: "The number of secondary private IPv4 addresses to assign to a network interface. When you specify a number of secondary IPv4 addresses, Amazon EC2 selects these IP addresses within the subnet's IPv4 CIDR range. You can't specify this option and specify more than one private IP address using privateIpAddresses. The number of IP addresses you can assign to a network interface varies by instance type. For more information, see IP Addresses Per ENI Per Instance Type in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide."
