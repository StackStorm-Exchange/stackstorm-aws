    description: "An array of EnvironmentVariable objects that specify environment variables to be associated with the app. After you deploy the app, these variables are defined on the associated app server instance. For more information, see  Environment Variables. There is no specific limit on the number of environment variables. However, the size of the associated data structure - which includes the variables' names, values, and protected flag values - cannot exceed 10 KB (10240 Bytes). This limit should accommodate most if not all use cases. Exceeding it will cause an exception with the message, 'Environment: is too large (maximum is 10KB).'  This parameter is supported only by Chef 11.10 stacks. If you have specified one or more environment variables, you cannot modify the stack's Chef version. "
