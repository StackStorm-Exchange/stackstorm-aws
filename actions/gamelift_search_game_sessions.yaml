  FilterExpression:
    type: string
    description: "String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in ACTIVE status. A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:    Operand -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, maximumSessions, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.    Comparator -- Valid comparators are: =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=.     Value -- Value to be searched for. Values can be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings. String values are case sensitive, enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators = and &lt;&gt;. For example, the following filter expression searches on gameSessionName: 'FilterExpression': 'gameSessionName = 'Matt\\\\'s Awesome Game 1''.    To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords AND, OR, and NOT and parentheses as needed. For example: x AND y AND NOT z, NOT (x OR y). Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:    =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=    Parentheses   NOT   AND   OR   For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: 'maximumSessions&gt;=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true'. "
  SortExpression:
    type: string
    description: "Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the following elements:    Operand -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, maximumSessions, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.    Order -- Valid sort orders are ASC (ascending) and DESC (descending).   For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions first: 'SortExpression': 'creationTimeMillis ASC'. Results with a null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list."

    type: string
    description: "Token indicating the start of the next sequential page of results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this action. To specify the start of the result set, do not specify a value."
