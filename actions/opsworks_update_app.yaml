There is no specific limit on the number of environment variables. However, the size of the associated data structure - which includes the variables' names, values, and protected flag values - cannot exceed 10 KB (10240 Bytes). This limit should accommodate most if not all use cases. Exceeding it will cause an exception with the message, 'Environment: is too large (maximum is 10KB).'  This parameter is supported only by Chef 11.10 stacks. If you have specified one or more environment variables, you cannot modify the stack's Chef version. "
