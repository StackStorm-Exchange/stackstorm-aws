Can specify a DB instance that is a PostgreSQL Read Replica only if the source is running PostgreSQL 9.3.5.   The specified DB instance must have automatic backups enabled, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.   If the source DB instance is in the same region as the Read Replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier.   If the source DB instance is in a different region than the Read Replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For more information, go to  Constructing a Amazon RDS Amazon Resource Name (ARN).  "

The following list shows the default behavior in each case.    Default VPC:true    VPC:false   If no DB subnet group has been specified as part of the request and the PubliclyAccessible value has not been set, the DB instance will be publicly accessible. If a specific DB subnet group has been specified as part of the request and the PubliclyAccessible value has not been set, the DB instance will be private."
