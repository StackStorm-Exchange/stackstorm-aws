The following list shows the default behavior in each case.    Default VPC:true    VPC:false   If no DB subnet group has been specified as part of the request and the PubliclyAccessible value has not been set, the DB instance will be publicly accessible.

    description: "The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to CloudWatch Logs. For example, arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess. For information on creating a monitoring role, go to To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring. If MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, then you must supply a MonitoringRoleArn value."
  KmsKeyId:
    type: string
    description: "The AWS KMS key ID for an encrypted Read Replica. The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.  If you create an unencrypted Read Replica and specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, Amazon RDS encrypts the target Read Replica using the specified KMS encryption key.  If you create an encrypted Read Replica from your AWS account, you can specify a value for KmsKeyId to encrypt the Read Replica with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for KmsKeyId, then the Read Replica is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB instance.   If you create an encrypted Read Replica in a different AWS region, then you must specify a KMS key for the destination AWS region. KMS encryption keys are specific to the region that they are created in, and you cannot use encryption keys from one region in another region."
  PreSignedUrl:
    type: string
    description: "The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the  CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API action in the AWS region that contains the source DB instance. The PreSignedUrl parameter must be used when encrypting a Read Replica from another AWS region. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API action that can be executed in the source region that contains the encrypted DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:    DestinationRegion - The AWS Region that the Read Replica is created in. This region is the same one where the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica action is called that contains this presigned URL.   For example, if you create an encrypted Read Replica in the us-east-1 region, and the source DB instance is in the west-2 region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica action in the us-east-1 region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica action in the us-west-2 region. For this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 region.    KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the Read Replica in the destination region. This is the same identifier for both the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica action that is called in the destination region, and the action contained in the presigned URL.    SourceDBInstanceIdentifier - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted Read Replica to be created. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source region. For example, if you create an encrypted Read Replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 region, then your SourceDBInstanceIdentifier would look like this example:  arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-instance-20161115.
