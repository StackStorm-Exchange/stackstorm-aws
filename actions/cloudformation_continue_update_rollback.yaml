    description: "The name or the unique ID of the stack that you want to continue rolling back.  Don't specify the name of a nested stack (a stack that was created by using the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource). Instead, use this operation on the parent stack (the stack that contains the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource). "

  RoleARN:
    type: string
    description: "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to roll back the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials."
  ResourcesToSkip:
    type: array
    description: "A list of the logical IDs of the resources that AWS CloudFormation skips during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify only resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state for other reasons, for example, because an update was canceled. To check why a resource update failed, use the DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason.   Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that AWS CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you  troubleshoot resources before skipping them. AWS CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to UPDATE_COMPLETE and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.   Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources.  To specify resources in a nested stack, use the following format: NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID. You can specify a nested stack resource (the logical ID of an AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource) only if it's in one of the following states: DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_COMPLETE, or DELETE_FAILED. "
