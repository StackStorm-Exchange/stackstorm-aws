    type: integer
    description: "The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a lower integer value for the priority parameter) are evaluated first when associated with same compute environment. Priority is determined in ascending order, for example, a job queue with a priority value of 1 is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of 10."

    description: "The set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to determine which compute environment should execute a given job. Compute environments must be in the VALID state before you can associate them with a job queue. You can associate up to 3 compute environments with a job queue."
