  DryRun:
    type: boolean
    description: "Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation."
  InstanceIds:
    type: array
    description: "One or more instance IDs. Must be instances linked to a VPC through ClassicLink."
  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    group-id - The ID of a VPC security group that's associated with the instance.    instance-id - The ID of the instance.    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    vpc-id - The ID of the VPC that the instance is linked to.  "
  NextToken:
    type: string
    description: "The token to retrieve the next page of results."
  MaxResults:
    type: integer
    description: "The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another request with the returned NextToken value. This value can be between 5 and 1000; if MaxResults is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned. You cannot specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same request. Constraint: If the value is greater than 1000, we return only 1000 items."
