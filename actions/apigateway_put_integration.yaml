  uri:
    type: string
    description: "Specifies a put integration input's Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). When the integration type is HTTP or AWS, this field is required. For integration with Lambda as an AWS service proxy, this value is of the 'arn:aws:apigateway:&lt;region&gt;:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/&lt;functionArn&gt;/invocations' format."
  credentials:
    type: string
    description: "Specifies whether credentials are required for a put integration."
  requestParameters:
    type: object
    description: "A key-value map specifying request parameters that are passed from the method request to the back end. The key is an integration request parameter name and the associated value is a method request parameter value or static value that must be enclosed within single quotes and pre-encoded as required by the back end. The method request parameter value must match the pattern of method.request.{location}.{name}, where location is querystring, path, or header and name must be a valid and unique method request parameter name."
  requestTemplates:
    type: object
    description: "Represents a map of Velocity templates that are applied on the request payload based on the value of the Content-Type header sent by the client. The content type value is the key in this map, and the template (as a String) is the value."
  passthroughBehavior:
    type: string
    description: "Specifies the pass-through behavior for incoming requests based on the Content-Type header in the request, and the available mapping templates specified as the requestTemplates property on the Integration resource. There are three valid values: WHEN_NO_MATCH, WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES, and NEVER.   WHEN_NO_MATCH passes the request body for unmapped content types through to the integration back end without transformation. NEVER rejects unmapped content types with an HTTP 415 'Unsupported Media Type' response. WHEN_NO_TEMPLATES allows pass-through when the integration has NO content types mapped to templates. However if there is at least one content type defined, unmapped content types will be rejected with the same 415 response. "

  contentHandling:
    type: string
    description: "Specifies how to handle request payload content type conversions. Supported values are CONVERT_TO_BINARY and CONVERT_TO_TEXT, with the following behaviors:  CONVERT_TO_BINARY: Converts a request payload from a Base64-encoded string to the corresponding binary blob. CONVERT_TO_TEXT: Converts a request payload from a binary blob to a Base64-encoded string.  If this property is not defined, the request payload will be passed through from the method request to integration request without modification, provided that the passthroughBehaviors is configured to support payload pass-through."
