    description: "One or more network ACL IDs. Default: Describes all your network ACLs."
  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    association.association-id - The ID of an association ID for the ACL.    association.network-acl-id - The ID of the network ACL involved in the association.    association.subnet-id - The ID of the subnet involved in the association.    default - Indicates whether the ACL is the default network ACL for the VPC.    entry.cidr - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in the entry.    entry.egress - Indicates whether the entry applies to egress traffic.    entry.icmp.code - The ICMP code specified in the entry, if any.    entry.icmp.type - The ICMP type specified in the entry, if any.    entry.ipv6-cidr - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in the entry.    entry.port-range.from - The start of the port range specified in the entry.     entry.port-range.to - The end of the port range specified in the entry.     entry.protocol - The protocol specified in the entry (tcp | udp | icmp or a protocol number).    entry.rule-action - Allows or denies the matching traffic (allow | deny).    entry.rule-number - The number of an entry (in other words, rule) in the ACL's set of entries.    network-acl-id - The ID of the network ACL.    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    vpc-id - The ID of the VPC for the network ACL.  "
