  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    availability-zone - The Availability Zone of the instance.    event.code - The code for the scheduled event (instance-reboot | system-reboot | system-maintenance | instance-retirement | instance-stop).    event.description - A description of the event.    event.not-after - The latest end time for the scheduled event (for example, 2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z).    event.not-before - The earliest start time for the scheduled event (for example, 2014-09-15T17:15:20.000Z).    instance-state-code - The code for the instance state, as a 16-bit unsigned integer. The high byte is an opaque internal value and should be ignored. The low byte is set based on the state represented. The valid values are 0 (pending), 16 (running), 32 (shutting-down), 48 (terminated), 64 (stopping), and 80 (stopped).    instance-state-name - The state of the instance (pending | running | shutting-down | terminated | stopping | stopped).    instance-status.reachability - Filters on instance status where the name is reachability (passed | failed | initializing | insufficient-data).    instance-status.status - The status of the instance (ok | impaired | initializing | insufficient-data | not-applicable).    system-status.reachability - Filters on system status where the name is reachability (passed | failed | initializing | insufficient-data).    system-status.status - The system status of the instance (ok | impaired | initializing | insufficient-data | not-applicable).
