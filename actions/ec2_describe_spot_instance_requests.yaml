    description: "One or more Spot instance request IDs."
  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    availability-zone-group - The Availability Zone group.    create-time - The time stamp when the Spot instance request was created.    fault-code - The fault code related to the request.    fault-message - The fault message related to the request.    instance-id - The ID of the instance that fulfilled the request.    launch-group - The Spot instance launch group.    launch.block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination - Indicates whether the Amazon EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.    launch.block-device-mapping.device-name - The device name for the Amazon EBS volume (for example, /dev/sdh).    launch.block-device-mapping.snapshot-id - The ID of the snapshot used for the Amazon EBS volume.    launch.block-device-mapping.volume-size - The size of the Amazon EBS volume, in GiB.    launch.block-device-mapping.volume-type - The type of the Amazon EBS volume: gp2 for General Purpose SSD, io1 for Provisioned IOPS SSD, st1 for Throughput Optimized HDD, sc1for Cold HDD, or standard for Magnetic.    launch.group-id - The security group for the instance.    launch.image-id - The ID of the AMI.    launch.instance-type - The type of instance (for example, m3.medium).    launch.kernel-id - The kernel ID.    launch.key-name - The name of the key pair the instance launched with.    launch.monitoring-enabled - Whether monitoring is enabled for the Spot instance.    launch.ramdisk-id - The RAM disk ID.    network-interface.network-interface-id - The ID of the network interface.    network-interface.device-index - The index of the device for the network interface attachment on the instance.    network-interface.subnet-id - The ID of the subnet for the instance.    network-interface.description - A description of the network interface.    network-interface.private-ip-address - The primary private IP address of the network interface.    network-interface.delete-on-termination - Indicates whether the network interface is deleted when the instance is terminated.    network-interface.group-id - The ID of the security group associated with the network interface.    network-interface.group-name - The name of the security group associated with the network interface.    network-interface.addresses.primary - Indicates whether the IP address is the primary private IP address.    product-description - The product description associated with the instance (Linux/UNIX | Windows).    spot-instance-request-id - The Spot instance request ID.    spot-price - The maximum hourly price for any Spot instance launched to fulfill the request.    state - The state of the Spot instance request (open | active | closed | cancelled | failed). Spot bid status information can help you track your Amazon EC2 Spot instance requests. For more information, see Spot Bid Status in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.    status-code - The short code describing the most recent evaluation of your Spot instance request.    status-message - The message explaining the status of the Spot instance request.    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    type - The type of Spot instance request (one-time | persistent).    launched-availability-zone - The Availability Zone in which the bid is launched.    valid-from - The start date of the request.    valid-until - The end date of the request.
