  ChildId:

    description: "The unique identifier (ID) of the OU or account whose parent containers you want to list. Do not specify a root. The regex pattern for a child ID string requires one of the following:   Account: a string that consists of exactly 12 digits.   Organizational unit (OU): a string that begins with 'ou-' followed by from 4 to 32 lower-case letters or digits (the ID of the root that contains the OU) followed by a second '-' dash and from 8 to 32 additional lower-case letters or digits.  "

  NextToken:
    type: string
    description: "Use this parameter if you receive a NextToken response in a previous request that indicates that there is more output available. Set it to the value of the previous call's NextToken response to indicate where the output should continue from."
  MaxResults:
    type: integer
    description: "(Optional) Use this to limit the number of results you want included in the response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the maximum you specify, the NextToken response element is present and has a value (is not null). Include that value as the NextToken request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should check NextToken after every operation to ensure that you receive all of the results."
