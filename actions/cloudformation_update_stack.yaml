  StackName:
    type: string
    description: "The name or unique stack ID of the stack to update."
    required: true
  TemplateBody:
    type: string
    description: "Structure containing the template body with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. (For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.) Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the TemplateURL parameter, but not both."
  TemplateURL:
    type: string
    description: "Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to a template that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, go to Template Anatomy in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the TemplateURL parameter, but not both."
  UsePreviousTemplate:
    type: boolean
    description: "Reuse the existing template that is associated with the stack that you are updating."
  StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody:
    type: string
    description: "Structure containing the temporary overriding stack policy body. You can specify either the StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody or the StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL parameter, but not both. If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy during this update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be used."
  StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL:
    type: string
    description: "Location of a file containing the temporary overriding stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody or the StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL parameter, but not both. If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary overriding stack policy during this update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be used."
  Parameters:
    type: array
    description: "A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type."
  Capabilities:
    type: array
    description: "A list of values that you must specify before AWS CloudFormation can update certain stacks. Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account, for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge their capabilities by specifying this parameter. The only valid values are CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. The following resources require you to specify this parameter:  AWS::IAM::AccessKey,  AWS::IAM::Group,  AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile,  AWS::IAM::Policy,  AWS::IAM::Role,  AWS::IAM::User, and  AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition. If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary. If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability. If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. If you don't specify this parameter, this action returns an InsufficientCapabilities error. For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates."
  ResourceTypes:
    type: array
    description: "The template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this update stack action, such as AWS::EC2::Instance, AWS::EC2::*, or Custom::MyCustomInstance. If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, AWS CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for AWS CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Controlling Access with AWS Identity and Access Management."
  RoleARN:
    type: string
    description: "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to update the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. AWS CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, AWS CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials."
  StackPolicyBody:
    type: string
    description: "Structure containing a new stack policy body. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both. You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack is unchanged."
  StackPolicyURL:
    type: string
    description: "Location of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both. You might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack is unchanged."
  NotificationARNs:
    type: array
    description: "Amazon Simple Notification Service topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that AWS CloudFormation associates with the stack. Specify an empty list to remove all notification topics."
  Tags:
    type: array
    description: "Key-value pairs to associate with this stack. AWS CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum number of 10 tags. If you don't specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags. If you specify an empty value, AWS CloudFormation removes all associated tags."
