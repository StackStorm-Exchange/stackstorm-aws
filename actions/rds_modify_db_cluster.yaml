  DBClusterIdentifier:
    type: string
    description: "The DB cluster identifier for the cluster being modified. This parameter is not case-sensitive. Constraints:   Must be the identifier for an existing DB cluster.   Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.   First character must be a letter.   Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.  "

  NewDBClusterIdentifier:

  ApplyImmediately:
    type: boolean
    description: "A value that specifies whether the modifications in this request and any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as possible, regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for the DB cluster. If this parameter is set to false, changes to the DB cluster are applied during the next maintenance window. The ApplyImmediately parameter only affects the NewDBClusterIdentifier and MasterUserPassword values. If you set the ApplyImmediately parameter value to false, then changes to the NewDBClusterIdentifier and MasterUserPassword values are applied during the next maintenance window. All other changes are applied immediately, regardless of the value of the ApplyImmediately parameter. Default: false "
  BackupRetentionPeriod:
    type: integer
    description: "The number of days for which automated backups are retained. You must specify a minimum value of 1. Default: 1 Constraints:   Must be a value from 1 to 35  "

  OptionGroupName:
    type: string
    description: "A value that indicates that the DB cluster should be associated with the specified option group. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage except in the following case, and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is set to true for this request. If the parameter change results in an option group that enables OEM, this change can cause a brief (sub-second) period during which new connections are rejected but existing connections are not interrupted.  Permanent options cannot be removed from an option group. The option group cannot be removed from a DB cluster once it is associated with a DB cluster."
  PreferredBackupWindow:
    type: string
    description: "The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, using the BackupRetentionPeriod parameter.  Default: A 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time per region.
