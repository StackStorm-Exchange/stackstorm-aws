  EventSourceArn:
    type: string
    description: "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Kinesis or the Amazon DynamoDB stream that is the event source. Any record added to this stream could cause AWS Lambda to invoke your Lambda function, it depends on the BatchSize. AWS Lambda POSTs the Amazon Kinesis event, containing records, to your Lambda function as JSON."
    required: true
  FunctionName:
    type: string
    description: "The Lambda function to invoke when AWS Lambda detects an event on the stream.  You can specify the function name (for example, Thumbnail) or you can specify Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function (for example, arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:account-id:function:ThumbNail).   If you are using versioning, you can also provide a qualified function ARN (ARN that is qualified with function version or alias name as suffix). For more information about versioning, see AWS Lambda Function Versioning and Aliases  AWS Lambda also allows you to specify only the function name with the account ID qualifier (for example, account-id:Thumbnail).  Note that the length constraint applies only to the ARN. If you specify only the function name, it is limited to 64 character in length."

  StartingPosition:
    type: string
    description: "The position in the stream where AWS Lambda should start reading. Valid only for Kinesis streams. For more information, see ShardIteratorType in the Amazon Kinesis API Reference. "

    type: boolean
    description: "Indicates whether AWS Lambda should begin polling the event source. By default, Enabled is true. "
  BatchSize:
    type: integer
    description: "The largest number of records that AWS Lambda will retrieve from your event source at the time of invoking your function. Your function receives an event with all the retrieved records. The default is 100 records."
  StartingPositionTimestamp:
    type: string
    description: "The timestamp of the data record from which to start reading. Used with shard iterator type AT_TIMESTAMP. If a record with this exact timestamp does not exist, the iterator returned is for the next (later) record. If the timestamp is older than the current trim horizon, the iterator returned is for the oldest untrimmed data record (TRIM_HORIZON). Valid only for Kinesis streams. "
