  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    cidr - The IPv4 CIDR block of the VPC. The CIDR block you specify must exactly match the VPC's CIDR block for information to be returned for the VPC. Must contain the slash followed by one or two digits (for example, /28).    dhcp-options-id - The ID of a set of DHCP options.    ipv6-cidr-block-association.ipv6-cidr-block - An IPv6 CIDR block associated with the VPC.    ipv6-cidr-block-association.association-id - The association ID for an IPv6 CIDR block associated with the VPC.    ipv6-cidr-block-association.state - The state of an IPv6 CIDR block associated with the VPC.    isDefault - Indicates whether the VPC is the default VPC.    state - The state of the VPC (pending | available).    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    vpc-id - The ID of the VPC.  "
