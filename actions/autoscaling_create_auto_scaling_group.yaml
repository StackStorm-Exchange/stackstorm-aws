  InstanceId:
    type: string
    description: "The ID of the instance used to create a launch configuration for the group. Alternatively, specify a launch configuration instead of an EC2 instance. When you specify an ID of an instance, Auto Scaling creates a new launch configuration and associates it with the group. This launch configuration derives its attributes from the specified instance, with the exception of the block device mapping. For more information, see Create an Auto Scaling Group Using an EC2 Instance in the Auto Scaling User Guide."
  DesiredCapacity:

    type: integer
    description: "The amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes before another scaling activity can start. The default is 300. For more information, see Auto Scaling Cooldowns in the Auto Scaling User Guide."

  HealthCheckType:
    type: string

  HealthCheckGracePeriod:
    type: integer
    description: "The amount of time, in seconds, that Auto Scaling waits before checking the health status of an EC2 instance that has come into service. During this time, any health check failures for the instance are ignored. The default is 0. This parameter is required if you are adding an ELB health check. For more information, see Health Checks in the Auto Scaling User Guide."
  PlacementGroup:
