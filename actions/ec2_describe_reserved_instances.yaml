Instances that include (Amazon VPC) in the product platform description will only be displayed to EC2-Classic account holders and are for use with Amazon VPC (Linux/UNIX | Linux/UNIX (Amazon VPC) | SUSE Linux | SUSE Linux (Amazon VPC) | Red Hat Enterprise Linux | Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Amazon VPC) | Windows | Windows (Amazon VPC) | Windows with SQL Server Standard | Windows with SQL Server Standard (Amazon VPC) | Windows with SQL Server Web | Windows with SQL Server Web (Amazon VPC) | Windows with SQL Server Enterprise | Windows with SQL Server Enterprise (Amazon VPC)).    reserved-instances-id - The ID of the Reserved Instance.    start - The time at which the Reserved Instance purchase request was placed (for example, 2014-08-07T11:54:42.000Z).    state - The state of the Reserved Instance (payment-pending | active | payment-failed | retired).    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    usage-price - The usage price of the Reserved Instance, per hour (for example, 0.84).  "
