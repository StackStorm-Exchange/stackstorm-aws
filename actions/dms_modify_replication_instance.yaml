  PreferredMaintenanceWindow:
    type: string
    description: "The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage, except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If moving this window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied.

    description: " Indicates that minor version upgrades will be applied automatically to the replication instance during the maintenance window. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage except in the following case and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. An outage will result if this parameter is set to true during the maintenance window, and a newer minor version is available, and AWS DMS has enabled auto patching for that engine version. "
