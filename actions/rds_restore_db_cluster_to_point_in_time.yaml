  KmsKeyId:
    type: string
    description: "The KMS key identifier to use when restoring an encrypted DB cluster from an encrypted DB cluster. The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS encryption key. If you are restoring a DB cluster with the same AWS account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key. You can restore to a new DB cluster and encrypt the new DB cluster with a KMS key that is different than the KMS key used to encrypt the source DB cluster. The new DB cluster will be encrypted with the KMS key identified by the KmsKeyId parameter. If you do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then the following will occur:   If the DB cluster is encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source DB cluster.   If the DB cluster is not encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is not encrypted.   If DBClusterIdentifier refers to a DB cluster that is note encrypted, then the restore request is rejected."
